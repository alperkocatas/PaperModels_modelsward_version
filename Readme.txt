The folders contain the code generated from the sample model presented as Figure 1 in the paper.
PaperModels.rpy includes the UML format for all of the figures presented in the paper in IBM Rhapsody 8.1.1 format. 
The image file Figure-1-Detailed.bmp is a view of the UML model which can be used if IBM Rational Rhapsody is not available.

In the model, please refer to the package PaperModels::SampleModel to see the UML model in Figure 1. 
The source code provided in this repository is generated using the Microsoft configuration of SampleModelCmp component using the different approaches. The .h and .cpp files for classes Engine, Throttle, Ecu, GasPedal and Dashboard can be viewed and compared in order to see the differences of the approaches.
